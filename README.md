## Business Requirements
### Functional Requirements

- Users can access the chatroom via a web browser.
- Upon connection, The chatroom assigns each user a random nickname generated from predefined lists.
- Users can send text-based chat messages.
- The chatroom broadcasts each chat message to all connected clients in real time.
- Notifications are generated and broadcast when users join or leave the chat.

### Non-Functional Requirements (Rules)

- The chatroom ensures real-time communication with minimal latency using Socket.IO.
- The chat interface is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
- The chatroom supports a small to moderate number of concurrent connections in a single public chat room.=
- The server is built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO, and listens on port 3000.
- The application is deployable in a standard Node.js hosting environment.
- The codebase remains focused on the core chat functionality to ensure ease of maintenance.

## Q&A (Challenges)

1. Why is there no option for sending private messages between users in the chatroom?
    > The current MVP roadmap is focused on delivering a streamlined, public chat experience. Private messaging is planned for future releases once the core real-time functionality is stable.

2. Why don't we see any user authentication or profile management features in the chatroom?
    > A: The MVP prioritizes ease of access by eliminating complex authentication steps. Roadmap planning has deferred user profiles and authentication until after the essential messaging features have been successfully implemented.

3. Why is there no persistent chat history available for users after reloading the page?
    > A: Maintaining real-time interactions is the primary goal of the MVP. Persistent chat history is not included in the initial roadmap but is scheduled as an enhancement for future updates once the basic functionality is proven and user feedback is gathered.
